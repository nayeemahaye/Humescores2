This is a dead simple solution for managing columns in a WordPress theme, done with React and jQuery Sortable UI. It's far from a perfect React coding example, but it does it's job.

Feel free to play with it, fork it, fix it, share ideas and use it in your own projects. A github project link will come soon.

Required packages:

* autobind-decorator
* babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy
* babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread
* babel-preset-es2015
* babel-preset-react
* babelify
* browser-cookies
* gulp
* gulp-browserify
* gulp-uglify
* react
* react-dom

You can install these via NPM with the following command line:

`npm install --save-dev autobind-decorator babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react babelify browser-cookies gulp gulp-browserify gulp-uglify react react-dom`

After all packages are installed you can run the `gulp` command, and start playing with the source app.js file.
